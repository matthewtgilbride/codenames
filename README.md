# codenames

Hi.  This is a personal project that exists for two reasons:

1. To learn Rust
2. To make my own version of [codenames](https://codenames.game/) that I can play with friends and family (inspiration: [horsepaste](https://github.com/jbowens/codenames))

The [service](./service) directory contains some rust code that someday (hopefully), will become a REST service
supporting gameplay.  The [app](./app) directory will contain a web app serving as the user interface.

See the [Makefile](Makefile) to run locally.
